The Massachusetts Education Overview is a recent project that showcases a Tableau dashboard created from The Massachusetts Department of Education's database. The project aims to provide useful information for superintendents, including graduation rates, school performance, class size vs college attendance, and 4th-grade math level. The report provides a comprehensive overview of education in Massachusetts and offers insights that can help improve the educational system.
